#Aespa Token is a simple ERC20 token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. This token is designed to demonstrate basic token functionalities such as minting, transferring, burning, and setting block rewards.

#Features
Minting: Only the owner can mint new tokens.
Transferring: Tokens can be transferred between accounts.
Block Reward: A fixed number of tokens are minted and rewarded to the miner of each block.
Token Destruction: The owner can destroy tokens from their own balance.

#Usage
Once the smart contract is deployed, you can interact with it using web3.js, ethers.js, or any Ethereum development framework.

For example, you can mint new tokens, transfer tokens between accounts, set block rewards, and destroy tokens by calling the respective functions provided by the smart contract.
